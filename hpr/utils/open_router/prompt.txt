I have a Samsung Galaxy S20 that has been completely wiped and is currently in download (Odin) mode. It is connected via USB to a Raspberry Pi 5. I have already downloaded a Linux OS folder that I want to flash to the phone. Please provide clear and detailed step-by-step instructions to perform the flashing process from the Raspberry Pi. Make sure to address the ARM64 architecture of the Pi and include any tools, drivers, or dependencies required for this task.
